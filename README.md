## Final Description of Application: Sport-Android-App

Our application is designed for keeping track of consumed protein per day with the ability to see the amount which is left and revise consumed products, including adding photos. The user can be notified about the protein consumption at the chosen time. Another important function is to observe exercises predefined in the application and create custom workouts. The application also allows you to record data about a personâ€™s body measurements (Weight, Height, biceps size, and so on).
